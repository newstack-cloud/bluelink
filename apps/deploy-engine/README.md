The engine that validates and deploys blueprints for applications
created with the Celerity framework in addition to more general infrastruture as code deployments.

The deploy engine bundles the plugin framework's gRPC-based plugin system that allows for the creation of custom plugins for providers and transformers that can be pulled in at runtime.
The deploy engine also bundles a limited set of state persistence implementations for blueprint instances, the persistence implementation can be chosen with configuration.

## Installing

The Deploy Engine is available for installation as a part of the standard Celerity installation.
See the [installing Celerity documentation](https://celerityframework.io/docs/intro/installing-celerity) for more information.

### Docker

You can also run the Deploy Engine as a Docker container using the public Docker image.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/two-hundred/celerity-deploy-engine:latest
```

## Configuration

The deploy engine is configured through environment variables. This section lists both required and optional configuration along with default values.

For the current implementation of the deploy engine, only `v1` is supported.

**default value:** `v1`

#### Port

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_PORT`

_**optional**_

The port that the deploy engine will listen on for incoming requests. This is used to configure the HTTP server.

**default value:** `8325`

#### Use Unix Socket?

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_USE_UNIX_SOCKET`

_**optional**_

If set to `true`, the deploy engine will use a Unix socket instead of a TCP socket. This is used to configure the HTTP server and should only be used when the deploy engine is running on a local machine where deployments and Celerity applications are managed with local state.

**default value:** `false`

#### Unix Socket Path

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH`

_**optional**_

The path to the Unix socket that the deploy engine will listen on for incoming requests. This is used to configure the HTTP server and should only be used when the deploy engine is running on a local machine where deployments and Celerity applications are managed with local state.

The default behaviour is to only allow access from the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) where connections
are only accepted from the same machine the deploy engine is running on.
This needs to be intentionally set to `false` to allow access over a wider private network or the public internet.

**default value:** `true`

#### Environment

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_ENVIRONMENT`

_**optional**_

The environment that the deploy engine is running in. This is used to determine things like the formatting of logs, in development mode, logs are formatted in a more human readable format,
while in production mode, logs are formatted purely in JSON for easier parsing and processing by log management systems.
This can be set to `development` or `production`.

**default value:** `production`

#### Log Level

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_LOG_LEVEL`

_**optional**_

The log level that the deploy engine will use. This is used to determine the verbosity of the logs that are generated by the deploy engine.
This can be set to any of the logging levels supported by zap:

The issuer URL of an OAuth2/OIDC JWT token that can be used to authenticate with the deploy engine. This is used to verify the JWT token provided with the bearer scheme in the `Authorization` header of all requests.
There can only be one issuer configured for an instance of the deploy engine.
This will be checked before the Celerity signature and API key authentication methods.

See the [JWTs](https://celerityframework.io/docs/auth/jwts) documentation for more information on the requirements for the issuer.

**Example:**
```
CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_AUTH_OAUTH2_OIDC_JWT_ISSUER=oauth.example.com
```

#### OAuth2/OIDC JWT Issuer Secure

#### Celerity Signature v1 Key Pairs

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_AUTH_CELERITY_SIGNATURE_V1_KEY_PAIRS`

_**required, if Celerity Signature v1 authentication will be used**_

A comma-separated list of Celerity signature key pairs that can be used to authenticate with the deploy engine. This is used to verify the Celerity signature provided in the `Celerity-Signature-V1` header of all requests.

The key pairs are in the format `keyId:secretKey`, where the public key is used to verify the signature and the private key is used to sign the request.

The deploy engine will check the `Celerity-Signature-V1` header of all requests.
This will be checked after the OAuth2/OIDC JWT bearer token authentication method and before the API key authentication method.

**Example:**
```
CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_AUTH_CELERITY_SIGNATURE_V1_KEY_PAIRS=keyId1:secretKey1,keyId2:secretKey2
```

#### API Keys

_**required, if API key authentication will be used**_

A comma-separated list of API keys that are allowed to access the deploy engine. This is used to authenticate all requests to the deploy engine.
The deploy engine will check the `Celerity-Api-Key` header of all requests.
This will be checked after the JWT bearer token and Celerity signature authentication methods.

**Example:**
```
CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_AUTH_API_KEYS=key1,key2,key3
```

### Plugins

Configuration for the plugin host used to manage and interact with plugins for providers and transformers.

#### Plugin Path

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_PLUGIN_PATH`

_**optional**_

The path to one or more plugin root directories separated by colons.

**default value:** `$HOME/.celerity/deploy-engine/plugins/bin`

#### Plugin Log File Root Directory

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_PLUGIN_LOG_FILE_ROOT_DIR`

_**optional**_

The path to the root directory where plugin log files will be stored.
stdout and stderr for each plugin will be redirected to log files under this directory.

**default value:** `$HOME/.celerity/deploy-engine/plugins/logs`

#### Plugin Launch Timeout in Milliseconds

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_PLUGIN_LAUNCH_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`

_**optional**_

**default value:** `15000` (15 seconds)

#### Total Plugin Launch Timeout in Milliseconds

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_PLUGIN_TOTAL_LAUNCH_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`

_**optional**_

#### Resource Stabilisation Polling Timeout in Milliseconds

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_RESOURCE_STABILISATION_POLLING_TIMEOUT_MS`

_**optional**_

The timeout in milliseconds to wait for a resource to stabilise before giving up and returning an error.
This is used both in the context of plugins and the deploy engine itself.

The purpose of this for plugins is in link plugins that are given access to a helper interface
to deploy resources managed by the host, the link plugin will call into the resource registry of the host
to deploy resources and wait for them to stabilise before returning.

In the deploy engine, this will be used to wait for resources to stabilise before continuing to deploy the next elements of the blueprint that can only be deployed once the current resource is stable.

**default value:** `3600000` (1 hour)

#### Plugin to Plugin Call Timeout in Milliseconds

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_PLUGIN_TO_PLUGIN_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS`

_**optional**_

The timeout in milliseconds to wait for a plugin to respond to a call initiated from within a plugin before giving up and returning an error.
This helps eliminate infinite waits in the case of a plugin that is not responding or has crashed or where an erroneous recursive call could lead to an infinite loop.
The exception, where this timeout is not used, is when a link plugin is waiting for a resource to stabilise,
in which case the resource stabilisation polling timeout will be used.

**default value:** `120000` (2 minutes)

### Blueprints

Configuration for the blueprint loader/container used to load and manage blueprint instances along with validating source blueprint files.

#### Validate After Transform

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_BLUEPRINTS_VALIDATE_AFTER_TRANSFORM`

_**optional**_

Determines whether or not the blueprint loader should validate blueprints after applying transformations.
This should only really be set to true when there is a need to debug issues that may be due to transformer
plugins producing invalid output.

**default value:** `false`

#### Enable Drift Checks

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_BLUEPRINTS_ENABLE_DRIFT_CHECK`

_**optional**_

Determines whether or not the deploy engine should check for drift in the state of resources
when staging changes for a blueprint deployment.
Drift checks use the `GetExternalState` method of a resource implementation to check the state of the resource against the upstream provider.

**default value:** `true`

#### Resource Stabilisation Polling Interval in Milliseconds

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_BLUEPRINTS_RESOURCE_STABILISATION_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`

_**optional**_

The interval in milliseconds to wait between polling for a resource to stabilise.
This is used both in the context of plugins and the deploy engine itself.
The purpose of this for plugins is in link plugins that are given access to a helper interface
to deploy resources managed by the host, the link plugin will call into the resource registry of the host
to deploy resources and wait for them to stabilise before returning.
In the deploy engine, this will be used to wait for resources to stabilise before continuing to deploy the next elements of the blueprint that can only be deployed once the current resource is stable.

**default value:** `5000` (5 seconds)

#### Default Retry Policy

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_BLUEPRINTS_DEFAULT_RETRY_POLICY`

_**optional**_

The default retry policy to use when a provider returns a retryable error for actions
that support retries.
This should be a serialised JSON string that matches the structure of the `provider.RetryPolicy` struct.
The built-in default will be used if this is not set or the JSON is not in the correct format.
When a provider plugin has its own retry policy, that will always be used instead of the default.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "maxRetries": 5,
    "firstRetryDelay": 2,
    "maxDelay": 300,
    "backofFactor": 2,
    "jitter": true
}
```

The actual value in the environment variable will need to be in a single line and escaped appropriately.

#### Deployment Timeout in Seconds

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_BLUEPRINTS_DEPLOYMENT_TIMEOUT`

_**optional**_

The timeout in seconds to wait for a deployment to complete before giving up and returning an error.
This timeout is for the background process that runs the deployment when the deployment endpoints are called.

**default value:** `10800` (3 hours)

### State

#### Storage Engine

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_STATE_STORAGE_ENGINE`

_**optional**_

The storage engine to use for the state management/persistence layer.
This can be set to `memfile` for in-memory storage with file system persistence
or `postgres` for a PostgreSQL database.

Postgres should be used for deploy engine deployments that need to scale horizontally,
the in-memory storage with file system persistence engine should be used for local deployments,
CI environments and production use cases where the deploy engine is not expected to scale horizontally.

If opting for the in-memory storage with file system persistence engine,
it would be a good idea to backup the state files to a remote location
to avoid losing all state in the event of a failure or destruction of the host machine.

**default value:** `memfile`

#### Recently Queued Events Threshold

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_STATE_RECENTLY_QUEUED_EVENTS_THRESHOLD`

_**optional**_

_**optional**_

This sets the guide for the maximum size of a state chunk file in bytes
when using the in-memory storage with file system (memfile) persistence engine.
If a single record (instance or resource drift entry) exceeds this size,
it will not be split into multiple files.
This is only a guide, the actual size of the files are often likely to be larger.

**default value:** `1048576` (1MB)

#### `memfile` Storage Engine Max Event Partition File Size

`CELERITY_DEPLOY_ENGINE_STATE_MEMFILE_MAX_EVENT_PARTITION_SIZE`

_**optional**_

This sets the maximum size of an event channel partition file in bytes
when using the in-memory storage with file system (memfile) persistence engine.
Each channel (e.g. deployment or change staging process) will have its own partition file
for events that are captured from the blueprint container.
This is a hard limit, if a new event is added to a partition file
that causes the file to exceed this size, an error will occur and the event
will not be persisted.
