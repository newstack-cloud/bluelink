# Commit Guidelines

## 1) Conventional Commits

For all contributions to this repo, you must use the conventional commits standard defined [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

This is used to generate automated change logs, allow for tooling to decide semantic versions for packages and applications,
provide a rich and meaningful commit history along with providing
a base for more advanced tooling to allow for efficient searches for decisions and context related to commits and code.

### Commit types

**The following commit types are supported in the Bluelink project:**

- `fix:` - Should be used for any bug fixes.
- `build:` - Should be used for functionality related to building an application.
- `revert:` - Should be used for any commits that revert changes.
- `wip:` - Should be used for commits that contain work in progress.
- `feat:` - Should be used for any new features added, regardless of the size of the feature.
- `chore:` - Should be used for tasks such as releases or patching dependencies.
- `ci:` - Should be used for any work on GitHub Action workflows or scripts used in CI.
- `docs:`- Should be used for adding or modifying documentation.
- `style:` - Should be used for code formatting commits and linting fixes.
- `refactor:` - Should be used for any type of refactoring work that is not a part of a feature or bug fix.
- `perf:` - Should be used for a commit that represents performance improvements.
- `test:` - Should be used for commits that are purely for automated tests.
- `instr:` - Should be used for commit that are for instrumentation purposes. (e.g. logs, trace spans and telemetry configuration)

### Commit scopes

**The following commit scopes are supported:**

This list will evolve as more applications and libraries are added to Bluelink.

- `blueprint` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the blueprint library/framework.
- `blueprint-resolvers` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the blueprint resolvers library that provides a collection of child blueprint resolvers to load child blueprints from various locations.
- `blueprint-state` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the blueprint state library that provides core state container implementations to be used in the deploy engine or other applications built on top of the blueprint framework.
- `blueprint-ls` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the Blueprint Language Server.
- `plugin-docgen` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the plugin docgen tool that generates a JSON document for the plugin that can be used to generate documentation in the Bluelink Registry.
- `deploy-engine` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the deploy engine application.
- `deploy-engine-client` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the deploy engine client library that is used to communicate with the deploy engine.
- `common` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the common Go library.
- `cli` - This commit scope should be used for a commit that represents work that pertains to the CLI for the test/build/package/deploy tooling.

The commit scope can be omitted for changes that cut across these scopes.
However, it's best to check in commits that map to a specific scope where possible.


### Commit footers

**The following custom footers are supported:**

- `GitHubIssue: #xxx` - This footer must be provided when a commit pertains to some work where there is a GitHub issue. 
  This helps with tooling that links GitHub issues to commits providing a way to easily get extra context and requirements
  that are related to a commit. You can also use the `#xxx` reference in the body of the message to reference GitHub issues.

### Example commit

#### With commit scope

```bash
git commit -m 'feat(blueprint): add cloud pub/sub resource types

Adds some pub/sub resource types including AWS SNS + SQS and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

GitHubIssue: #2391
'
```

#### Without commit scope

```bash
git commit -m 'fix: correct default server configuration for multiple environments'
```

## 2) You must use the imperative mood for commit headers.

https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#imperative

The imperative mood simply means naming the subject of the commit as if it is a unit of work that can be applied instead of reporting facts about work done.

If applied, this commit will **your subject line here**.
