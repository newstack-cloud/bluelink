    spec:
      # Environment variables are set at the API level so the spec is compatible
      # with a containerised deployment without undesired, confusing behaviour
      # when you define env vars for individual handlers and some values would
      # be overridden when deployed as an API server.
      #
      # The linking behaviour also injects environment variables to be used at runtime,
      # these environment variables are displayed in the `deploy` and `dry-run` commands
      # and can be exported to a file, so you know what environment variables you can
      # reference from code.
