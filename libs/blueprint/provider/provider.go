// Provider is the interface for an implementation of a provider
// of a set of resource and data source types that can be used in a blueprint.
// An example of a provider could be a cloud provider such as AWS
// or Google Cloud.

// When we have links between resources of different providers, a new provider
// implementation should be implemented to act as a bridge between the two providers
// the linked resources belong to.

	// Link retrieves a link plugin to handle a link between two resource types
	// in a blueprint.
	Link(ctx context.Context, resourceTypeA string, resourceTypeB string) (Link, error)
	// CustomVariableType retrieves a custom variable type plugin to handle validating
	// convenience variable types with a (usually large) fixed set of possible values.
	// These custom variable types should not be used for dynamically sourced values
	// external to a blueprint, data sources exist for that purpose.
	CustomVariableType(ctx context.Context, customVariableType string) (CustomVariableType, error)

	// querying the upstream data source.

	// implementation returns an error of type `provider.RetryableError`,
