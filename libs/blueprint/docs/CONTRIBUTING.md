# Contributing to the blueprint framework

## Getting set up

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) >=1.22

Dependencies are managed with Go modules (go.mod) and will be installed automatically when you first
run tests.

If you want to install dependencies manually you can run:

```bash
go mod download
```

## Running tests

```bash
bash ./scripts/run-tests.sh

# to re-generate snapshots (For spec/schema tests)
bash scripts/run-tests.sh --update-snapshots
```

## Generating protobuf code

The blueprint framework uses protobuf to store and transmit an expanded version of a blueprint. Expanded blueprints include AST-like expansions of substitutions that can be cached with an implementation of the `cache.BlueprintCache` interface.

1. Follow the instructions [here](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/#install-using-a-package-manager) to install the `protoc` compiler.

2. Install the Go protoc plugin:

```bash
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
```

3. Run the following command from the `libs/blueprint` directory to generate the protobuf code:

```bash
protoc --go_out=./schemapb --go_opt=paths=source_relative ./schema.proto
```

## Releasing

To release a new version of the library, you need to create a new tag and push it to the repository.

The format must be `libs/blueprint/vX.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the semantic version number.
The reason for this is that Go's mechanism for picking up modules from multi-repo packages is based on the sub-directory path being in the version tag.

See [here](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#publishing-a-release).

1. add a change log entry to the `CHANGELOG.md` file following the template below:

```markdown
## [0.2.0] - 2024-06-05

### Fixed:

- Corrects error reporting for change staging.

### Added

- Adds retry behaviour to resource providers.
```

2. Create and push the new tag prefixed by sub-directory path:

```bash
git tag -a libs/blueprint/v0.2.0 -m "chore(blueprint): Release v0.2.0"
git push --tags
```

Be sure to add a release for the tag with notes following this template:

Title: `Blueprint Framework - v0.2.0`

```markdown
## Fixed:

- Corrects claims handling for JWT middleware.

## Added

- Adds dihandlers-compatible middleware for access control.
```

3. Prompt Go to update its index of modules with the new release:

```bash
GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org go list -m github.com/two-hundred/celerity/libs/blueprint@v0.2.0
```

## Commit scope

Example commit:

```bash
git commit -m 'fix(blueprint): correct cyclic dependency bug'
