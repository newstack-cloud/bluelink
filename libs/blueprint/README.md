The blueprint framework is the foundation for Celerity application deployments managed by the [deploy engine](../deploy-engine), it can also be used as a standalone framework for cloud and other resource deployment systems.

The framework is made up of a collection of modules containing orchestration functionality for planning and deploying blueprints along with a collection of interfaces for resource provider plugins, state persistence, and other useful components in the framework's model. See the [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) or the [blueprint framework](https://www.celerityframework.io/blueprint-framework/docs/intro) docs for more information.

This is an implementation of the [Blueprint Specification](https://celerityframework.io/docs/blueprint/specification).
