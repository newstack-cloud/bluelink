# Runtime API Docs

The Celerity Runtime provides two HTTP APIs that allow the runtime to interact with processes running on the same host (machine or container) as the runtime.

- [Local Runtime API](./local-runtime-api/README.md) - The Local Runtime API allows the runtime to interact with an executable containing an application's handlers.
- [Handler Invoke API](./handler-invoke-api/README.md) - The Handler Invoke API allows developers to invoke handlers directly in their local development environments.
