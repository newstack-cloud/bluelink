# Handler Invoke API

The Celerity Handler Invoke API allows developers to invoke handlers directly in their local development environments.
This is designed to be used in local development environments and is not intended for use in production. Handlers in the same application can invoke each other in production environments but use a separate, internal mechanism to do so.

This API is mostly useful for testing and debugging locally.
