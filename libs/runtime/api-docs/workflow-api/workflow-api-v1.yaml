  title: Workflow API
  description: |-
    This is the HTTP API for interacting with a Celerity Workflow application.

    This allows for triggering workflow executions, monitoring the status of a workflow execution and retrieving execution history for the workflow.

    This API is designed to interact with a single workflow as opposed to a general workflows service, when deployed with the Celerity workflow runtime, each workflow is its own application.
tags:
  - name: trigger
    description: Endpoints for triggering an execution of the workflow.
  - name: "monitor & history"
    description: Endpoints to retrieve the state of executions of the workflow, to monitor current executions and retrieve past executions.

parameters:
  CeleritySignatureHeader:
    name: Celerity-Signature-V1
    type: string
    in: header
    required: false
    description: |
      A header containing a signature in the [Celerity Signature v1](https://celerityframework.com/docs/auth/signature-v1) format.
      This is used to authenticate requests to Workflow API endpoints.
      This is required if an API key and a bearer token are not present and the Workflow application is configured to use signature auth.
    example: 'keyId="test-key-id" headers="Celerity-Date X-Custom-Header" signature="{signature}"'
