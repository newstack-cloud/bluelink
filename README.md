### Blueprint framework

The blueprint framework provides a set of interfaces and tools to deploy and manage the lifecycle of resources that can be represented as a blueprint. The framework is designed to be minimal at its core, yet extensible and can be used to deploy resources in any environment.

The blueprint framework is an implementation of the [Celerity Blueprint Specification](https://celerityframework.com/docs/blueprint/specification).
