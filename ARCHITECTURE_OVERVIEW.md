# Architecture Overview

Celerity is a backend toolkit that gets you moving fast. It is designed to be a set of libraries, example projects and tools that can be used to build, test, package, and deploy high quality applications at a fast pace.

Utilising Celerity as an application development framework allows developers to focus on solving problems and delivering value to their customers without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure and tooling. However, Celerity provides enough flexibility to give as much control as needed by developers.

The following diagram provides an overview of the components that make up Celerity and how they interact with each other:
