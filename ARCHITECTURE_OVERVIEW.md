# Architecture Overview

TODO: replace with simpler architecture overview for Bluelink

Celerity is a backend toolkit that gets you moving fast. It is designed to be a set of libraries, example projects and tools that can be used to build, test, package, and deploy high quality applications at a fast pace.

Utilising Celerity as an application development framework allows developers to focus on solving problems and delivering value to their customers without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure and tooling without being locked in to a specific vendor. If you need to delve deeper, Celerity provides enough flexibility to give as much control as needed by developers and infrastructure specialists.

The following diagram provides an overview of the components that make up Celerity and how they interact with each other:
